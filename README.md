# BBF

**BBF** [1] is an fine-tuning approach that bases on boosting [2] and Bagging [3]. It is designed to be efficient with the following advantages:


- Support of fine-tuning an initial model for classification.
- Support of fine-tuning an initial model for regression.

## Get Started and Documentation

Our primary documentation is at https://bbf.readthedocs.io and is generated from this repository. If you are new to BBF, follow [the installation instructions](https://bbf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-Intro.html) on that site. The preferred way to install BBF is via pip from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/BBF).
