Welcome to BBF's documentation!
===============================
**BBF** [1] is an fine-tuning approach that bases on boosting [2] . It is designed to be efficient with the following advantages:


- Support of fine-tuning an initial model for classification.
- Support of fine-tuning an initial model for regression.
